- `paths`
  - `src` Type `string` Required: Specifies the source directory of the website code.
  - `tmp` Type `string` Required: The temporary directory for serving the compiled website.
  - `dist` Type `string` Required: Distribution directory for compiled and compressed code.

- `sourcemaps` Type `boolean|regex|function` Required: Add sourcemaps. (see: [gulp-if](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-if))
- `cname` Type `string` Optional: Add `CNAME` file when deploying with this url.

## Style Guide
You should follow the [Angular Style Guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide) by John Papa.

## File Injection
Script and style files, both custom built and installed from bower, may be injected into markup files. To do this, you must include associated comment tags into any markup file you wish to have the scripts/styles included in. Bellow is an example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Title</title>
    <!-- bower:css -->
    <!-- bower installed css files will go here... -->
    <!-- endinject -->
    <!-- inject:css -->
    <!-- css files will go here... -->
    <!-- endinject -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- bower:js -->
    <!-- bower installed scripts will go here... -->
    <!-- endinject -->
    <!-- inject:js -->
    <!-- js files will go here... -->
    <!-- endinject -->
  </body>
</html>
```

## Authentication
Authentication is controlled by firebase. You can setup your own authentication system or use one of Firebase's techniques (see [here](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/libraries/angular/guide/user-auth.html)). To prevent an unauthenticated user from accessing a route; set data.authenticate to true, like so:

```js
/** @ngInject */
function routeConfig($stateProvider) {
  $stateProvider
    .state('base.rock', {
      url: '/rock',
      templateUrl: 'app/rock/rock.html',
      controller: 'RockController',
      controllerAs: 'vm',
      data: {
        authenticate: true,
      },
    });
}
```
